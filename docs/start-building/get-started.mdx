PayLink empowers you to add payment capabilities to your AI agents. Choose the integration pattern that best fits your use case.

## Integration Patterns

PayLink supports two primary integration models, each designed for different use cases and levels of autonomy.

### Agent to Human

Your agent initiates a payment that requires human approval before completion. This pattern keeps users in control while enabling agents to trigger payment requests.

**Best for:**
- **Consumer‑facing** applications where users must approve transactions
- **Compliance requirements** that mandate human oversight
- Payment providers requiring user authentication M‑Pesa STK Push
- Applications where trust and transparency are critical

**How it works:**
1. Your agent identifies a need for payment
2. Agent initiates a payment request via PayLink
3. User receives a prompt
4. User authorizes the transaction
5. Payment processes and agent receives confirmation

### Agent to Agent

Your agent transacts autonomously using its own wallet. No human confirmation required for each transaction.

**Best for:**
- Autonomous agent ecosystems
- Micropayment scenarios requiring speed
- Agent‑to‑agent marketplaces
- Monetized MCP tools and services
- Machine‑to‑machine payments

**How it works:**
1. Agent receives a wallet with funds
2. Agent autonomously decides to make a payment
3. Transaction executes immediately via blockchain
4. Both agents receive instant confirmation
