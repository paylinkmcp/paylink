## What is an Organization?

An organization in PayLink is the top-level entity that represents your company, team, or business entity. It serves as the primary container for managing multiple projects, API keys, and team members within a single account.

## Key Characteristics

- **Top-Level Container**: Organizations are the highest level of hierarchy in PayLink
- **Ownership**: Each organization has a single owner (the user who created it)
- **Team Management**: Organizations can have multiple members with different roles (owner, admin, member)
- **Logical Separation**: Organizations provide isolation between different business entities
- **Default Organization**: You can mark one organization as your default for easier access

## Organization Structure

```
Organization
├── Projects
│   ├── Project 1
│   │   ├── Wallet (automatically created)
│   │   └── Traces
│   └── Project 2
│       ├── Wallet (automatically created)
│       └── Traces
├── API Keys
│   └── Organization-scoped authentication
└── Team Members
    ├── Owner
    ├── Admin
    └── Member
```


## Use Cases

- **Company Accounts**: Represent your company or business entity
- **Team Collaboration**: Organize multiple developers working on different projects
- **Multi-Organization Work**: Developers working for different organizations can create separate organizations for each client or employer, keeping resources completely isolated
- **Access Control**: Manage permissions and roles at the organization level
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related projects and resources together

## Creating an Organization

When you sign up for a PayLink account, your first organization is automatically created for you. This makes it easy to get started you can immediately begin creating projects and API keys within your default organization.

You can also create additional organizations at any time. This is particularly useful for developers who work with multiple organizations or companies. For example, if you're a freelance developer working for different clients, you can create separate organizations for each client to keep their projects, API keys, and resources completely isolated.

## Organization Features

- **Multiple Projects**: Create unlimited projects within an organization
- **Team Invitations**: Invite team members with different roles and permissions
- **API Key Management**: Create and manage API keys scoped to your organization
- **Cascade Management**: When an organization is deleted, all associated projects, API keys, and members are automatically removed

## Important Notes

- You must be a member of an organization to create projects or API keys within it
- Organizations provide logical separation between different business entities
- Each user can own multiple organizations and be a member of others
- The organization owner has full control over all resources within the organization
