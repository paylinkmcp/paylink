<Steps>
  <Step title="Install PayLink">
    Make sure PayLink is installed in your environment. Follow the [Installation](/get-started/install) guide if you still need to set it up.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a PayLink account">
    Ensure you have a PayLink account created. Follow the [Create an account](/get-started/create-an-account) guide if you haven't already.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create two separate projects">
    This walkthrough showcases an example of how to monetize an MCP server and how to use that MCP in an agent, allowing the agent to pay for tool invocations.

    You'll need to create two separate projects on PayLink. Each project will automatically create wallets attached to those projects. Create one project called **MCP** and another called **AGENT**. In real-world applications, these should live on two different accounts, but for testing purposes, you can have them on the same account.

    If you want to learn more about how PayLink organizes **projects** and **wallets**, see the [Project](/resources/project) and [Wallet](/resources/wallet) guides.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up wallet connection strings">
    Navigate to each project's **Wallets** tab in the PayLink dashboard and copy the connection token for each wallet.

    **In your MCP project**, create an `.env` file with the following:

    ```bash
    MCP_WALLET_CONNECTION_STRING="your_mcp_wallet_connection_string"
    ```

    **In your agent project**, create an `.env` file with the following:

    ```bash
    WALLET_CONNECTION_STRING="your_agent_connection_string"
    ```

    Replace the placeholder values with the actual connection tokens from your PayLink projects.
  </Step>
</Steps>


### Next Steps

Now that you have your environment configured and wallet connection token ready, you can:
- Build a basic [MCP server without payment](/agent-to-agent/mcp-agent-unmonetized) to understand the fundamentals
- Add [monetization to your MCP server](/agent-to-agent/mcp-agent-monetized) to require payment from agents
