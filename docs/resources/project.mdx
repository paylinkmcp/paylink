## What is a Project?

A project in PayLink is a logical grouping unit within an organization that represents a specific application, service, or product. Projects are the primary unit for organizing payment operations, traces, and are automatically associated with wallets upon creation.

## Key Characteristics

- **Organization-Scoped**: Every project must belong to exactly one organization
- **Automatic Wallet Creation**: When a project is created, a corresponding wallet is automatically created
- **Trace Container**: Projects collect and organize all traces related to payment operations
- **Active Status**: Projects can be activated or deactivated without deletion
- **Access Control**: Access to projects is controlled through organization membership

## Project Structure

```
Project
├── Wallet (automatically created)
│   └── Manages funds and transactions
├── Traces
│   └── Records of payment operations
└── Configuration
    ├── Payment Provider Settings
    └── Project-specific Settings
```

## Relationships

- **Belongs to Organization**: Each project belongs to one organization (required)
- **Has One Wallet**: Each project has one associated wallet (created automatically)
- **Contains Traces**: A project can have multiple traces recording payment operations
- **Created by User**: Each project is created by one user who must be a member of the organization

## Common Use Cases

- **Application Representation**: Represent a specific application or microservice
- **Environment Separation**: Create separate projects for development, staging, and production
- **Service Organization**: Organize payment-related operations by service or product
- **Trace Management**: Group and track payment operations for a specific application

## Creating a Project

1. Log in to your PayLink organization
2. Navigate to the Projects section
3. Click "Create New Project"
4. Provide a project name (required) and optional description
5. The project is created and a wallet is automatically created for it

## Automatic Wallet Creation

When you create a project:
- A wallet is automatically created and associated with the project
- Wallet creation happens asynchronously to avoid blocking
- If wallet creation fails initially, the project still exists and the wallet can be created later
- The wallet is managed by PayLink's wallet service

## Project Lifecycle

- **Active Projects**: Can process payments and create traces
- **Inactive Projects**: Can be deactivated without deletion, preserving historical data
- **Project Deletion**: When a project is deleted, all associated traces are automatically deleted, and the wallet deletion is attempted

## Important Notes

- Projects cannot exist without an organization
- You must be a member of the organization to create or access projects
- Each project automatically gets its own wallet for managing funds
- Projects serve as the primary container for tracking payment operations through traces
- Project names should be descriptive to help identify their purpose
