<Steps>
  <Step title="Install PayLink">
    Make sure PayLink is installed and configured locally. Follow the [Installation](/get-started/install) guide if you haven't already.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a PayLink account">
    Ensure you have a PayLink account created. Follow the [Create an account](/get-started/create-an-account) guide if you haven't already.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your environment">
    To be able to trace tool invocation, we need the following:

    ```bash
    PAYLINK_API_KEY="paylink api key"
    PAYLINK_PROJECT="Paylink project"
    PAYLINK_TRACING="enabled"
    ```

    After creating a project on PayLink platform, copy the project name and update your `.env`. Create an API key and update the `.env` as well.

    PayLink will support different payment providers, but currently we only support M-Pesa, so set:

    ```bash
    PAYMENT_PROVIDER=["mpesa"]
    ```

    Create an account on M-Pesa Daraja and obtain the following:

    ```bash
    MPESA_BUSINESS_SHORTCODE="your_shortcode"
    MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET="your_consumer_secret"
    MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY="your_consumer_key"
    MPESA_CALLBACK_URL="your_callback_url"
    MPESA_PASSKEY="mpesa_passkey"
    MPESA_BASE_URL="nhhnh"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Use sandbox credentials while testing to avoid live charges.
</Tip>

###  Next Steps

Now that we have our `.env` with all the variables set, let's test that everything is working correctly before building a real agent.
