To install the core PayLink package:

<CodeGroup>
```bash uv
uv add --prerelease=allow paylink
```

```bash pip
pip install --pre -U paylink
```
</CodeGroup>


## Configure your environment

After installation, create an isolated Python environment and populate a `.env` file that the SDK can read at runtime:

<CodeGroup>
```bash uv
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
touch .env  # or copy from a template if you have one
```

```bash pip
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
touch .env  # or copy from a template if you have one
```
</CodeGroup>

Add the following variables to your environment (you can place them in `.env` or export them directly in your shell):

```bash
PAYLINK_API_KEY="your api key"
PAYLINK_PROJECT="your project name"
PAYLINK_TRACING="enabled"
```

Replace the sample API key with your own secret before running `paylink`.
