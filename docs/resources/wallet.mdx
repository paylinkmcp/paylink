## What is a Wallet?

A wallet in PayLink is a financial account that gives your AI agents the ability to send and receive funds. Wallets are automatically created when you create a project and enable agents to autonomously handle payments, manage balances, and process financial transactions. Each wallet is associated with a project and managed by PayLink's secure wallet service.

## Key Characteristics

- **Automatic Creation**: Wallets are automatically created when a project is created
- **Project-Scoped**: Each wallet is uniquely associated with one project
- **External Service**: Wallets are managed by PayLink's secure wallet service
- **One-to-One Relationship**: Each project has exactly one wallet
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Wallets are automatically deleted when their associated project is deleted

## How Wallets Work

### Automatic Creation

When you create a project:
1. The project is created in the PayLink system
2. A wallet is automatically created and associated with the project
3. Wallet creation happens asynchronously to ensure fast project creation
4. The wallet is ready to handle payments once created

### Wallet Operations

Wallets give agents the capability to:
- **Send Funds**: Agents can send payments to other agents or process outgoing transactions
- **Receive Funds**: Agents can receive payments from other agents or from users
- **Manage Balances**: Track and manage funds for the project
- **Process Transactions**: Handle financial transactions autonomously

## Use Cases

### Agent-to-Agent Payments

- Agent A requests a service from Agent B
- Agent A uses its wallet to send funds to Agent B
- Agent B receives the payment in its wallet
- Service is delivered automatically



### Enabling Agent Autonomy

- Agents can send and receive funds without human intervention
- Wallets provide agents with financial autonomy for transactions
- Agents can manage their own payment operations
- Enables fully autonomous agent economies

## Wallet Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Automatically created when a project is created
2. **Active Use**: Handles payments and manages balances during project operation
3. **Deletion**: Automatically deleted when the associated project is deleted

## Important Notes

- Wallets are created automatically you don't need to create them manually
- Wallet creation is asynchronous and non-blocking
- If wallet creation fails initially, the project still exists and the wallet can be created later
- When a project is deleted, wallet deletion is attempted automatically
- Wallets are managed securely by PayLink's wallet service
- Each project has exactly one wallet you cannot create multiple wallets per project

## Best Practices

- **Monitor Balances**: Regularly check wallet balances for your projects
- **Review Transactions**: Use traces to review payment operations
- **Project Organization**: Use separate projects (and their wallets) for different environments or services
- **Security**: Access to wallets is controlled through project and organization permissions
